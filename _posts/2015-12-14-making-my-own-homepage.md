Apprenticeship 

The word apprentice may conjure up slightly varying images.

I researched an online [dictionary][0] and for me I have discovered a meaning which seems to adequately define the position I hope to offer people.

I would like to offer my services as a certified and experienced teacher; life coach; therapist, to guide people to also becoming such a certified and experienced professional.

I am offering an apprenticeship in:

TEACHING LANGUAGES

COACHING

THERAPY

COUNSELING

CONSULTING

I have 20+ years experience in teaching a language to second language speakers. ESL生徒さんに英語・英語コミュニケーションを教える20年以上の経験があります。

I have 7 years experience as a certified life coach. 資格とってからライフコーチとして、7年の経験

I received my certificate in hypnotherapy in 2015年に催眠術師の資格を取得して、セラピーセッションの経験も重ねて
